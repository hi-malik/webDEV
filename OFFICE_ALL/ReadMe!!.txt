Online KMS Activation:

 - This KMS script skips the activation of any permanently / KMS38-activated product.
 - This KMS script can activate both Retail and VL Windows / Server installation.
 - This KMS script can activate C2R Retail and VL Office, but not 2010/2013 MSI Retail Office. 

 ----------------------
 - Activation Renewal
 ----------------------

 - KMS activates Windows / Server / Office for 180 Days. (For Core/ProWMC edition it is 30/45 Days)

 - By design, using the KMS activation method, the system contacts the registered server every 7 
   days, and if contacted successfully it will automatically renew and reset the activation for the 
   the full period of 180 days again, starting from the day of successful contact.
   If the system cannot contact the server, it will be deactivated after 180 days and it will 
   remain deactivated until contact can be restored.
   
 - The KMS servers I've added have been working steadily for two to three years, but there can be 
   no guarantee that they will remain online indefinitely. If a registered server goes 
   down, you will need to create a renewal task, or do a manual renewal, for the lifetime of the 
   activation.

   There are 3 ways you can renew the KMS server and as a result, renew the activation.

 1- Activate.cmd

   Run this file whenever the system needs activation. Depending upon the particular (never fully-knowable)
   circumstances, a successful activation may last for a period of a MINIMUM of 180 days, 
   or a maximum of the full life of the machine it's running on, and you may never need to run it again.

 2- Manual Renewal via Desktop Context Menu

   This method is exactly same as above but here we put the following files in,
   C:\ProgramData\Online_KMS_Activation\BIN\cleanosppx64.exe
   C:\ProgramData\Online_KMS_Activation\BIN\cleanosppx86.exe
   C:\ProgramData\Online_KMS_Activation\Activate.cmd
   C:\ProgramData\Online_KMS_Activation\Info.txt

   and create registry entries in,
   HKCR\DesktopBackground\shell\Activate Windows - Office
   HKCR\DesktopBackground\shell\Activate Windows - Office\command

   It creates an easy to reach Desktop context menu for the manual activation renewal.

 3- Automatic Renewal via Task Scheduler
   
   This method put the following files in,
   C:\ProgramData\Online_KMS_Activation\BIN\cleanosppx64.exe
   C:\ProgramData\Online_KMS_Activation\BIN\cleanosppx86.exe
   C:\ProgramData\Online_KMS_Activation\Activate.cmd
   C:\ProgramData\Online_KMS_Activation\Info.txt

   And creates a scheduled task to run the script every 7 days.

   The scheduled task runs only if the system is connected to the Internet.
   With this method, the Activation task can also be created which will run on the system login
   and after successful activation, this task will delete itself.
  
   IMPORTANT NOTE - Some sensitive AV's may flag the Automatic Renewal via the Task, and not 
   because of KMS, because for them it's suspicious to run long scripts in the background as Tasks.

   It's recommended to set exclusions in Antivirus for
   C:\ProgramData\Online_KMS_Activation\Activate.cmd
   or
   use the 1st or 2nd option for activation renewal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ----------------------
 - Remarks
 ----------------------

 - This Online KMS Activation provides immediate global activation for Windows 8.1 and Windows 10, which 
   means that in the following three scenarios, the system will self-activate when connected to the 
   internet, and also means that users will not need to manually run the activation script again.

   Scenario 1: Subsequent installation or alteration of any 2013, 2016, or 2019 Volume License 
               (VL) Office product.
   Scenario 2: Windows edition change (with GVLK).
   Scenario 3: Date change, system hardware change, etc.

 - What is left in the system in the activation process?
   - Activate.cmd
     After activation, it leaves only the KMS Server name in the registry, which helps you to get the
     above-mentioned global activation feature whereby the system auto-renews the activations,
     so it's a good thing if you leave the server name in the registry.
     However, you can clear this registered KMS Server name upon activation, and do that, open 
     the script with notepad and set Clear-KMS-Cache to 1 from 0.
     What is left in the system when Renewal methods are installed, has been mentioned.

 - This script includes the most-stable KMS servers (6+) list. The server selection process is 
   fully automatic. You don't need to worry about the server's availability.

 - If your system date is incorrect (beyond 180 days) and you are offline, the system will be 
   deactivated, but will automatically reactivate when you correct the system date. 

 - Why should you choose the Online KMS activation method over offline KMS?
   The main benefit of Online KMS activation is that it doesn't need any KMS binary file and system
   can be activated using some manual commands or transparent batch script files.
   So this is for those who don't like/have difficulties/trust issue in offline KMS because of its 
   binary files and antivirus detections.

Renewal_Setup.cmd /dcm /swa

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Activate.cmd

   - To run the script in Debug mode to find out the cause of errors in activation or just details,
     search "set _Debug=" and change the value from 0 to 1. 

   - To replace KMS38 activation with KMS activation, search "set SkipKMS38=" and change the value 
     from 1 to 0. 

   - To skip Windows activation, search "set ActWindows=" and change the value from 1 to 0.
   - To skip Office activation, search "set ActOffice=" and change the value from 1 to 0.
     - This is not effective if Windows and/or Office installation is already Volume (GVLK installed)
     - In [Online KMS + HWID] $OEM$ preactivation, Windows KMS activation is turned off 
       by default.

   - To turn OFF auto conversion for Office C2R Retail to Volume, search "set AutoR2V=" and 
     change the value from 1 to 0.

   - To set the script to use only one specific KMS server address, search "set KMS_Server="
     paste the server address after the = sign.

   - To clear the KMS cache, search "set Clear-KMS-Cache=" and change the value from 0 to 1.
     - Registered KMS server address (cache) enables the system to automatically renew the license 
       (for next 180 days) every 7 days, as long as the server is online.
     - This process is the same as how the legal KMS works, so no security program will flag 
       this behavior.
     - Changing this option here won't have any effect if manual (Desktop Context menu) and/or auto, 
       renewal activation script is installed. [default (0)].
     - I recommend leaving this option as default (0).

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
 - Connect to the internet. 
 - Open CMD as Admin, and enter the following listed commands in the sequence in which they are given.
 - If Office is installed as VL (Volume License) then there is no need to enter its key. 
 - If Office is installed as Retail, then you need to convert it to VL, by using C2R-R2V by @abbodi1406
   https://forums.mydigitallife.net/posts/1150042 

 - Change to the directory where Office is installed.
   If your system is 32-bit Office on 32-bit Windows or 64-bit Office on 64-bit Windows use the following:
   
   For Office 2016 or 2019 enter the command:
   
cd "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office16"
   
   For Office 2013 enter the command:
   
cd "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office15"
   
   For Office 2010 enter the command:
   
cd "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14"
   
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
   If your system is 32-bit Office on 64-bit Windows, use the following:

   - Reboot the system and run the activation script, and if unsuccessful, 
     You may try to rebuild licensing Tokens.dat as suggested in https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2736303
     (this will require to repair Office afterwards.)

   - Reboot the system and run the activation script, and if unsuccessful, 
     Try KMS_VL_ALL by @abbodi1406 https://forums.mydigitallife.net/posts/838808/
     If still unsuccessful, it may be time to start over from the very beginning 
     and do a clean install of windows :D 

   -------------------------------

   - If you have issues with Office activation, or got undesired or duplicate licenses (e.g. Office 2016 and 2019):
     Download Office Scrubber pack from https://forums.mydigitallife.net/posts/1466365/
     To get rid of any conflicted licenses, run Uninstall_Licenses.cmd, then you must start any 
     Office program to repair the licensing. You may also try Uninstall_Keys.cmd for similar manner.

     If you wish to remove Office and leftovers completely and start clean:
     Uninstall Office normally from Control Panel / Programs and Feature then run Full_Scrub.cmd
     afterwards, install new Office.

   - Can't activate Windows 7 with KMS: [Error 0xC004F035]
     Some OEM licensed computers cannot be activated with KMS on WINDOWS 7.
     Quote from the MS page https://tinyurl.com/yy8wfu5m
     'Computers obtained through OEM channels that have an ACPI_SLIC table in the (BIOS) are 
     required to have a valid Windows marker in the same ACPI_SLIC table.
     ---Computers that have an ACPI_SLIC table without a valid Windows marker generate an error 
     when a volume edition of Windows 7 is installed.'
